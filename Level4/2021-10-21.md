#### 피드에 달린 커멘트를 들고 오는 과정
- `List<comments>` 가져온 후, likes를 Lazy Loading (N+1 쿼리 발생)
- Dto에서 likes.size() 를 조회하는 작업을 거치면서 lazy loading을 해옴
```java

    return CommentResponse.toList(comments, user);
}

    return comments.stream()
            .map(comment -> CommentResponse.of(comment, user.isCommentLiked(comment)))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
